──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Awe is a new compiler for the Algol W language. It is intended to to
be a correct and complete implementation of the language described in
the Algol W Language Description, June 1972.

Awe should be able to compile code intended for the System/360 ALGOLW
and XALGOLW compilers with little or no modification.

Awe uses Gnu C (with its extensions) as an intermediate language.
It allows Algol W programs to be linked to C object code.

Installion instructions are in the file INSTALL.

The manuals are in the file awe.txt and man pages awe.1 and awe.mk.7.
