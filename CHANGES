Awe is being distributed with only man page and examples as documentation for now.

This revision of Aw2c to Awe has some minor changes, mostly removal of misfeatures:

 * Closer to the Algol W standard.
 * Minor bug fixes.
 * Improved command line. Awe calls gcc for itself.
 * A general-purpose Makefile is included.
 * Awe accepts multiple source files, which allows a primitive module system.
 * "External class" references, for returning pointers from external procedures. (Necessary)
 * Ocaml source code carefully revised.  (The comments were drivel.)
 * Manual is gone for now.  (Revising it.)
 * Variables are now never initialized.  (Dijkstra says no)
 * Only OS/360 and MTS Algol comments are allowed now.  (Was non-standard)
 * The procedure call tracing code hooks are gone.  (Wasn't satisfactory)
 * "Ref" is now never a keyword.  (Non-standard)
 * There are no mechanisms for mixing C and Algol at the source level.  (Was non-standard) (Wasn't satisfactory)
 * Only "ALGOL" and "FORTRAN" are valid external procedure references now.  (Was non-standard)
 * Programs must always be statements now.  (Was non-standard)
 * "Windows Funpak" distribution is gone.  (Couldn't be linked to a garbage collector)
 * Records are now allowed as parameters to external procedures.
