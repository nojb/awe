This program lists files to the standard output with line numbers:

     list [files]...

It's nothing fancy.

But the code demonstrates how to use multiple Algol W source files as
a primitive module system, how to write and use external procedures in
C, and shows you a general-purpose Makefile for Algol W programs,
which you can reuse.
