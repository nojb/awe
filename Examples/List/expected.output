  0  |A rule appears in the makefile and says when and how to remake certain
  1  |files, called the rule's targets (most often only one per rule). It
  2  |lists the other files that are the dependencies of the target, and
  3  |commands to use to create or update the target.
test2.txt
  0  |The order of rules is not significant, except for determining the
  1  |default goal: the target for make to consider, if you do not otherwise
  2  |specify one. The default goal is the target of the first rule in the
  3  |first makefile. If the first rule has multiple targets, only the first
  4  |target is taken as the default. There are two exceptions: a target
  5  |starting with a period is not a default unless it contains one or more
  6  |slashes, `/', as well; and, a target that defines a pattern rule has
  7  |no effect on the default goal. (See section Defining and Redefining
  8  |Pattern Rules.)
test3.txt
  0  |Therefore, we usually write the makefile so that the first rule is the
  1  |one for compiling the entire program or all the programs described by
  2  |the makefile (often with a target called `all'). See section Arguments
  3  |to Specify the Goals.
