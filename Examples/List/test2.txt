The order of rules is not significant, except for determining the
default goal: the target for make to consider, if you do not otherwise
specify one. The default goal is the target of the first rule in the
first makefile. If the first rule has multiple targets, only the first
target is taken as the default. There are two exceptions: a target
starting with a period is not a default unless it contains one or more
slashes, `/', as well; and, a target that defines a pattern rule has
no effect on the default goal. (See section Defining and Redefining
Pattern Rules.)
