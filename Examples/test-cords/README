This is an example of interfacing an Algol program to an existing C
library: Hans Boehm's Cord data type.

(I've made the lazy assumption that 'char', 'size_t' are represented
by the same type as 'int'. It works on my 32-bit 686 system. I suspect
the interface would have to be defined more strictly on others.)
