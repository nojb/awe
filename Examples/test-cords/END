     An "end" to let the contents of a preceeding
     sequence of source files exist in the same scope,
     which gives you a primitive module system.
     The idea is that you do something like this: 
         
              awe BEGIN defs1.alw defs1.alw prog.alw END -c prog.c   

     (Note that prog.alw cannot end on a fullstop.) ;
END.
