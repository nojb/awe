$ parser-lexing-operators.dat -- some operator lexing peculiarities

$ "NOT" was introduced as an operator after 1972

a NOT= b
(a ~= b)

a NOT = b
(a ~= b)

a Not= b
(a ~= b)

a not = b
(a ~= b)

(not a)
(~ a)

$ Spaces are allowed between the two characters of an operator
$ (Any whitespace is, but I haven't allowed newlines)

a >= b
(a >= b)

a > = b
(a >= b)

a >  = b
(a >= b)
