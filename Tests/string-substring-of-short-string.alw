comment In A2WC generated code Algol strings can be represented by C
        strings shorter than the string length. This happens when
        string variables are assigned constants. Let's see if the
        substring operators can handle that;
begin
  string(6) a;
  string(6) b;

  a := "01";
  assert(a(2|2) = "  ");

  b := "01";
  b(3|2) := "xx";
  assert(b = "01 xx ")
end.
