  1  |Empty arrays

  4  |Hendrik Boom wrote to me that the OS/360 ALGOLW compiler allowed
  5  |"empty arrays" to be declared, with the semantics defined below, and
  6  |that using them made some algorithms considerably clearer. Awe allows
  7  |them also, for the sake of backward compatibility.

  9  |**Definition**
 10  |
 11  |Replace the last sentence of 5.2.2. *Array Declarations, Semantics* with this:
 12  |
 13  |    In order to be valid, for every bound pair, the value of the upper
 14  |    bound may be no lower than one less than the upper bound.  If a valid
 15  |    array has any bound pair where the upper bound is one less than the
 16  |    lower bound then it is an empty array.
 17  |
 18  |Replace the second sentence of 6.1.2. *Variables, Semantics* with this:
 19  |
 20  |    An array designator is invalid if its array identifier denotes an
 21  |    empty array (Cf. 5.2.2) or if any of its subscripts lie outside
 22  |    the declared bounds for that subscript's position.
